# This is log regex for 'grepping' the date and the 
# actual non-existent URL.
#
# Note: this regex must have at least two groups (i.e. two 
# sets of brackets) the first one being the date and 
# the second being the HTTP request
# 
# The following example access.log line:
# 192.168.1.65 - - [01/May/2011:00:55:40 +0100] "GET /YouCannotBeHereRightNow! HTTP/1.0" 404 225
# would yield back:
# 01/May/2011:00:55:40 +0100
# /YouCannotBeHereRightNow!

logging-regex-for-each-request=\\[(\\d{2}/\\w{3}/\\d{4}:\\d{2}:\\d{2}:\\d{2} .....)\\] \"GET /(\\S*) HTTP\\/1\\.
