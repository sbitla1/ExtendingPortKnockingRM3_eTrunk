The configuration of WebSpa, when running in server mode can
be found in a file called:

	'webspa-config.properties'
	
This file contains two (2) very important properties:

1. access-log-file-location
2. logging-regex-for-each-request

1. The access-log-file-location property is the location within
the filesystem where the access log file of the web server is.

This has a default value:
	'/var/log/apache2/access.log'
	
Which can be modified before starting webspa in server mode.

2. The logging-regex-for-each-request property is the regular
expression indicating where within each line of the access log
file the IP address and part of the URL are located.

This has a default value:
	'^([\\d.]+) \\S+ \\S+ \\[[\\w:/]+\\s[+\\-]\\d{4}\\] \"GET /(\\S*) HTTP\\/[1-2]\\.[0-1]\" \\d{3} \\d+ \"[^\"]+\" \"[^\"]+\"'

Which can also be modified before starting web-spa in server 
mode.

Please note that the regex specified must have exactly two 
groups (i.e. two sets of brackets) the first one being the IP
Address and the second being the HTTP GET request.
