The USER command allows you as a WebSpa administrator to:

1. Add New Users
2. Show the Current Users
3. Activate / De-activate User Accounts

1. Adding New Users 'user add'

When adding new users, you MUST:

1.1 Specify the user's name

This is used for reference purposes and is not actively 
entered in the generation of a new WebSpa request.

1.2 Specify the user's unique pass-phrase

What identifies each user uniquely is the pass-phrase you 
select. Also the security of the WebSpa channel is defined
by the strength of the password you set.

Finally, there are two optional fields that you MAY populate,
but have the choice of leaving blank. These are the user's 
e-mail address and phone number.

2. Show the Current Users 'user show'

This option displays the existing users of WebSpa. It lists
their unique 'ID', if their account is 'Active', each user's
'Full Name' and the last modification date of their account.

|Example Output:
|___________________________________________________________
|ID  Active  Full Name               Last Modified            
|-----------------------------------------------------------
|11  true    Jennifer                2013-09-01 22:43:40.459
|12  true    Paul                    2013-09-01 22:43:51.020
|13  false   Sandra                  2013-09-01 22:44:25.884
|___________________________________________________________

3. Activate / De-activate User Accounts 'user activate'

This option toggles the activation and de-activation of a
user account. 

Selecting a user with an existing ID (e.g. 11) will give you
the option to toggle their activation status.

Thus, if a user is active you can de-activate their account
and vice-versa.
