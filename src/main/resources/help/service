The SERVICE command allows you to start, stop and query the
current status of the WebSpa service. It does this in the 
following way:

1. Start the Service 'service start'
2. Stop the Service 'service stop'
3. Query the Status 'service status'

1. Starting the Service 'service start'

This enables to 'tail' log listening to begin on the file of 
your choice. The file is specified within the first property
 of the config setup. Please type 'show config' to understand
 which file this is.

2. Stopping the Service 'service stop'

This disables the log listening service and stops WebSpa from 
accepting any more commands in the form of WebKnocks.

3. Querying the Service Status 'service status'

This will return a message of the service either being started
or stopped. An example output can be seen below:

|WebSpa-server>service status
|
|WebSpa is Stopped
|
|WebSpa-server>

In this example the WebSpa service is stopped and no further 
O/S commands can be received as WebKnocks.
