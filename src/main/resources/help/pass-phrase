The PASS-PHRASE command allows you to view and change
pass-phrases for user accounts. 

This command can be used with the following OPTIONS

'pass-phrase show' - To display the pass-phrase of an
existing user

'pass-phrase modify' - To change the pass-phrase of an 
existing user

A normal user does not have the ability to change 
their pass-phrase. They rely on the WebSpa 
administrator for that.
