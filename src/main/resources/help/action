The ACTION command allows you as a WebSpa administrator to:


1. Add New Actions
2. Show the Current Actions

1. Adding New Action 'action add'

When adding new action, you MUST:

1.1 Specify the O/S command

This is used to map the action number to an actual Operating
System (O/S) command. 

It is important that the user assigned to execute this command
would be authorised to do so under the permissions that the 
WebSpa jar file is run under.

Also a valid, active user must already exist in order for the
O/S command to run successfully. Please user the command
'user add' to first add a user before using the 'action add'
command.

1.2 Specify a Unique Action Number [0-9]

Each command must be mapped to a single digit number. This 
number is a value that will be asked to be entered by a WebSpa
user utilsing the WebSpa client. 

Each O/S command is mapped to a unique number and each user can
only have 10 commands allocated to their pass-phrase.

If more than 10 O/S commands are required, a WebSpa 
administrator would have to create a secondary user account 
with a separate unique pass-phrase. 

2. Show the Current Actions 'action show'

This option displays the existing O/S commands for a user of
WebSpa. It lists each command number, the respective actual
O/S command and the time it was last executed.

|Example Output:
|Actions for user with ID: 12
|___________________________________________________________
| #  O/S Command                     Last Executed            
|-----------------------------------------------------------
| 0  sh -c "service apache2 star...  has never been executed
| 1  sh -c "service apache2 stop...  has never been executed
| 2  sh -c "/etc/init.d/ssh star...  has never been executed
| 3  sh -c "/etc/init.d/ssh stop...  has never been executed
| 4  sh -c "service mysql start;...  has never been executed
| 5  sh -c "service mysql stop; ...  has never been executed
|___________________________________________________________

In this example you can see WebSpa being setup to allow for
the start/stop of the apache web server, SSH and also the 
MySQL database.

Please note that 'action show' only works on an individual 
user basis: You can only list the actions of one user at a
time.
