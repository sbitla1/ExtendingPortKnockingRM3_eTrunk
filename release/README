Thank you for downloading WebSpa!
=================================================

This program is a web knocking implementation
that allows a single HTTP/S request to authorise 
an O/S command to be executed. 

Please also see the INSTALL file for further 
information.

=================================================
- The WebSpa download
=================================================

Each release of WebSpa comes in a single zip 
file called:

webspa-{xy}.zip

Where {xy} represents the version number. If you
had downloaded, say as an example, webspa-25.zip
you would be running WebSpa version 2.5 . 

=================================================
- Installing WebSpa on (*nix)
=================================================

Obtain a copy of the latest webspa-{xy}.zip

Typically, we like to store things in /opt, ergo:

bash-3.00# unzip webspa-{xy}.zip -d /opt/
Archive:  webspa-{xy}.zip
  inflating: ...
bash-3.00#cd /opt/webspa-{xy}

You can quickly test WebSpa, by issuing:

bash-3.00# java -jar webspa-06.jar -version
x.y
bash-3.00#

This will simply print the version of WebSpa
and return.

=================================================
- Running WebSpa on (*nix)
=================================================

In running the standalone jar file (i.e. 
webspa-{xy}.jar, you have to select one of the 
following four (4) options: 

  -client : Run the client, generate requests
  -help   : Print this usage message
  -server : Run the server
 -version : x.y

If no option is selected, the help message
detailing the above options will be displayed.

With each download of the standalone jar file 
(i.e. webspa-{xy}.zip, see section above)
there is a rather basic shell script available,
named 'WebSpa.sh'.

This script performs a `which java` and sets 
the initial and maximum Java heap size.

This script needs to be chmod-ed to have execute
permissions. If you have followed the
instructions above and placed WebSpa in /opt
issue the following: 

bash-3.00# chmod 744 /opt/webspa-{xy}/webspa.sh

You can test the WebSpa script, by issuing:
bash-3.00# ./webspa.sh -version
x.y
bash-3.00#

You will be required to have a java 1.6 JRE or
JDK installed. For more information see the 
INSTALL file.
